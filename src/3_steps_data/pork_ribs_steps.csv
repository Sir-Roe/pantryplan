2,7547750,3,"Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120  degrees C). Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil long enough to extend past the rack of ribs by at least 6 inches on both ends. Use large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs, meat side up, on the foil."
3,7547750,4,"Brush wet rub over top and sides, and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface. Turn ribs over and, with the bone side up, brush with wet rub, then sprinkle with all the remaining dry rub. Reserve any wet rub left at this point."

12,7547750,13,"Let ribs rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.Chef JohnHere’s a trick for telling whether your ribs are done that I learned from an old pitmaster. During one of the bastings near the end of the cooking time, place a pair of tongs under the full length of the center rib, and gently lift the rack off the baking sheet. If the ends of the rack droop, the ribs are nearly done. If the rack remains stiff, the ribs need more cooking time, and if the rack breaks in the center and falls apart, they are overcooked.The video shows an easy way to remove the membrane from the bone side of a rack of ribs, an optional step I rarely take, but I did for this recipe.Feel free to try other flavors of soda with this recipe, like root beer or ginger ale."
