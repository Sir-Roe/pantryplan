31,7547750,13,"Let ribs rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.Chef JohnHere’s a trick for telling whether your ribs are done that I learned from an old pitmaster. During one of the bastings near the end of the cooking time, place a pair of tongs under the full length of the center rib, and gently lift the rack off the baking sheet. If the ends of the rack droop, the ribs are nearly done. If the rack remains stiff, the ribs need more cooking time, and if the rack breaks in the center and falls apart, they are overcooked.The video shows an easy way to remove the membrane from the bone side of a rack of ribs, an optional step I rarely take, but I did for this recipe.Feel free to try other flavors of soda with this recipe, like root beer or ginger ale."
