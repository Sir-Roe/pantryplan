Place thawed and well-drained turkey on the work surface, and pat as dry as you can with a few paper towels. Arrange bird so backbone is facing up. Use a sharp pair of poultry shears to cut next to the backbone on one side from the tail end to the neck. You will be cutting through bones, so a firm grasp and sharp shears are a must. Use a paper towel or clean kitchen towel to ensure you have a good grasp of the bird if you are having any trouble."
56,6735743,4,"Grasp the bird with a paper towel on the cut side of the backbone and make another cut with poultry shears along the other side to free the backbone, removing it from the bird. Use your shears to cut the backbone into 3 to 4 pieces crosswise, and place on a plate to use later to make the gravy. Pick the bird up (you will now have a U-shaped turkey), flip it, and place turkey on the work surface with the breast facing up. Use the palms of your hands with fingers interlaced, and press quickly and firmly down on the breast bone of the bird to flatten it.

63,6735743,11,"Lightly wipe the same large saucepan clean with a paper towel, then add reserved fat to saucepan over medium-high. Add shallots to saucepan, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add flour to saucepan, and stir constantly until well-combined with fat, about 1 minute. Add strained liquid and enough chicken stock to measure a total of 6 cups liquid (about 2 additional cups of stock) to saucepan over medium-high. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly while boiling, for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium, and allow mixture to simmer and reduce by half, 25 to 30 minutes.
