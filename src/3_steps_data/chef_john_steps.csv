0,7965894,1,"Combine crabmeat, red chilies, sambal chili sauce, Sriracha, garlic, green onions, cilantro, lemon zest, sesame oil, and mayonnaise in a bowl. Mix thoroughly until all the ingredients are evening combined. Refrigerate for30 to 60 minutes or until needed."
1,7965894,2,"Grease plate or tray with sesame oil, and set aside."
2,7965894,3,"Dip rice paper wrapper in water for about 4 seconds, and transfer to a plate or the counter top."
3,7965894,4,"Place 3 rounded teaspoons of crab filling in the center, about 1  inch apart from each other."
4,7965894,5,"Once wrapper has softened up, and has become flexible, and a little bit stretchy, fold over the crab to seal in, pressing lightly between the sections. Fold the outside 1/2-inch of the wrapper on either side in toward center. Continue rolling the wrapper to form a relatively tight rolled noodle, ending up with the seam on the bottom."
5,7965894,6,Transfer stuffed noodles to the oiled plate. Continue stuffing and rolling until all of the filling has been used. Make sure to keep a little space between each stuffed noodle so they don’t stick together. Transfer finished noodles to fridge until ready to fry.
6,7965894,7,"To make the sauce, combine water, rice vinegar, oyster sauce, ketchup, sesame oil, and cornstarch in a small saucepan, and whisk thoroughly until the cornstarch is dissolved. Set saucepan onto stove over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring often. Simmer until sauce starts to thicken up, turns shiny, and has the consistency of a thin gravy, about 2 minutes."
7,7965894,8,"Turn off heat, and reserve sauce until noodles are pan-fried.Grease a nonstick pan with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Add stuffednoodles and cook over medium-high heat until golden brown on both sides and the filling is heated through, about 3 minutes per side."
8,7965894,9,"Serve topped with the warm sauce. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and minced red chilies if so desired.Chef John"
9,7852324,1,"Add 1 1/2 pounds of the blackberries (about 5 cups), sugar, and lemon juice to a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat."
10,7852324,2,"Use a potato masher to crush berries, and continue to simmer until mixture thickens and reduces by half, about 20 minutes. Heat can be turned up to reduce faster, but will require more careful watching to be sure blackberries do not scorch."
11,7852324,3,"Strain blackberry mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, being sure to get every drop of juice; discard fiber and seeds. Stir sweetened condensed milk and vanilla into the bowl; refrigerate mixture until completely cold, about 1 hour."
12,7852324,4,"Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until medium-stiff peaks form. Add half the whipped cream to chilled blackberry mixture; fold in with a whisk until almost all the cream is incorporated. Add remaining whipped cream; use a spatula to gently fold in. Pour mixture into a container, cover, and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours and up to overnight."
13,7852324,5,"To serve, add as many of the fresh berries you want to the top, and use an ice cream scoop to mix and smash them into the ice cream as you scoop. Add a few remaining berries on top of each serving.Chef John"
14,7749988,1,"Stir together salt, chili powder, smoked paprika, black pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne in a small bowl; set aside."
15,7749988,2,"Using a sharp knife, trim off both ends of each ear of corn to expose the cob. Stand cob on end, and carefully cut corn in half down the exact center of the cob, rocking the knife while applying downward pressure from the top. Stand each cob half on end, and cut into quarters using the same method. Transfer to a large mixing bowl."
16,7749988,3,"Drizzle oil over corn; sprinkle on about 2/3 of spice mixture. Toss well, being sure to smear spices and oil evenly over each rib."
17,7749988,4,"Ribs can now be finished on a charcoal grill, until hot and well browned."
18,7749988,5,"To finish indoors, preheat the oven’s broiler and set a rack 7 to 8 inches from the heating element. Line a baking pan with foil."
19,7749988,6,"Arrange corn ribs on the prepared pan with the maximum number of kernels facing up, toward the heat. Extra foil can be placed on the pan to prop up ribs into the right position. Once arranged, sprinkle with more spice mixture if so desired."
20,7749988,7,"Broil on High until corn starts to brown in spots, about 7 minutes. Remove and rearrange ribs as needed, so that areas of kernels that are not yet browned are facing up toward the heat, and continue to broil until corn is golden-brown with some charred spots, 7 to 8 minutes more."
21,7749988,8,Remove and brush with melted butter; season to taste with remaining spice mixture.Chef John
22,7643590,1,"Combine milk, water and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk in yeast, and let sit for 20 minutes."
23,7643590,2,"Add orange zest, vanilla, white sugar, eggs, melted butter, salt, and 4 1/2 cups flour. Use the dough hook to knead on low speed until mixture comes together, scraping sides of bowl as necessary."
24,7643590,3,"Increase speed one setting, and continue to knead until a soft, smooth, very elastic dough forms, 8 to 10 minutes. If dough seems very wet, and won’t pull away from the sides of bowl after about 5 minutes, add a little more flour in as needed. But, be careful not to add too much, or the brioche will be dry."
25,7643590,4,"Transfer dough to a work surface and shape into a ball. Transfer into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours."
26,7643590,5,"Transfer dough back to the work surface, press out air, and shape into a uniform log shape. Cut into 8 equal portions. For best results, use a digital scale to weigh dough, and then divide by 8, to get perfectly sized portions."
27,7643590,6,"After dividing, take each portion and cut off 15 to 20% of the dough, to use to make the smaller “tuppo” bun on top. For uniform portions, weigh each portion in grams, and then multiply by 0.17. That will be the amount that you should cut off the portion. My portions came out to 140 grams each, and 17% of that was 24 grams, which is the size I used for the “tuppo."""
28,7643590,7,"Line a baking sheet with a silpat sheet. Roll each of the 8 larger portions into a smooth ball. Place balls seam side down on the prepared baking sheet. Roll the smaller portions into smooth balls, and set on the baking sheet."
29,7643590,8,"Very lightly flour your index fingers, and use them to make a deep well in the center of each of the larger bun, into which you will place the tuppo. Before placing it, squeeze one end of the tuppo into a pointed shape to make it fit better. For best results, assemble one bun at a time. Lightly press to settle the tuppo into the bottom bun, so that it is attached, with half the tuppo above the surface of the bun, and half tucked inside."
30,7643590,9,"Once all buns are formed, place baking sheet into a turned-off oven to proof until doubled in size, about 1 hour."
31,7643590,10,Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Brush buns  gently but thoroughly with egg wash.
32,7643590,11,"Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove to cool for about 5 minutes before transferring buns to a cooling rack to cool completely.Chef John"
33,7642408,1,Fill a large red wine glass with fresh ice almost to the top.
34,7642408,2,"Add whole spices to the glass. These should be chosen to compliment the botanicals in the gin, and some common choices include juniper berries, peppercorns, star anise, cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon sticks. For a more pronounced flavor, whole spices can be “bruised” by pressing with your fingers, or the flat of a knife before adding."
35,7642408,3,"Pour in gin. Then very slowly and gently pour in tonic, so as not to lose the carbonation. For best results, use a “Mediterranean style” tonic instead of the classic Indian style, since they tend to be less bitter, and often include flavors like rosemary and lemon."
36,7642408,4,"Add slices and/or zest from the citrus fruit(s) of your choice. Use a cocktail stirrer or spoon to gently poke the ingredients down, and mix the drink. Do not stir vigorously!"
37,7642408,5,"Push in the fresh herb sprigs. Common choices are basil, thyme, mint, rosemary, or tarragon. For a stronger, more fragrant effect, slap the herbs between your hands, or squeeze between your fingers to activate the essential oils."
38,7642408,6,Serve 3 to 5 minutes after mixing to give drink time to chill thoroughly.Chef John
39,7569406,1,"Combine cilantro, garlic, serrano chile, lime juice, water, salt, pepper, and sugar in a tall cup or the jar of a blender; blend with a stick blender or regular blender until smooth. Refrigerate aguachile while other ingredients are prepared."
40,7569406,2,"Add shrimp, cucumber, and red onion to a bowl, and pour in aguachile. Stir well, and press shrimp down into aguachile to cover. Wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving.The dish can be served immediately, but refrigerating for 30 minutes to 1 hour will achieve a more ceviche-like (“cooked”) texture. The dish can also be tightly covered and refrigerated overnight to serve the next day."
41,7569406,3,"Sprinkle aguachile with jalapeno slices and cilantro to garnish, and serve with tortilla chips.Chef John"
42,7568213,1,"Stir yeast, sugar, and water together in a bowl; let sit for about 10 minutes."
43,7568213,2,"Stir in flour and mix until a dry, shaggy dough forms. Add salt, butter, and 2 tablespoons oil and mix to combine."
44,7568213,3,"Knead with your hands in the bowl until dough comes together, then turn out onto the counter and continue to knead until a stiff but smooth dough forms, about 1 to 2 minutes."
45,7568213,4,"Return dough to the bowl; rub the surface of the dough with a small amount of oil. Cover the bowl and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, up to 6 hours. Alternately, place dough in the refrigerator to rise overnight."
46,7568213,5,"Meanwhile, make the pizza sauce. Blend San Marzano tomatoes until smooth using a stick blender or in the jar of an electric blender. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of the tomato puree and place into a bowl. Stir in 1 teaspoon kosher salt, dried oregano, and cayenne pepper. Refrigerate until ready to make the pizzas."
47,7568213,6,Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Drizzle 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons oil into a 10- to 12-inch pizza pan.
48,7568213,7,"Divide dough into 4 pieces and roll into balls. Keep dough covered when not using. Press 1 dough ball into a round disc and place on the prepared pizza pan. Press and stretch dough flat, almost all the way to the edge of the pan. Poke the dough all over with a fork."
49,7568213,8,"Once the dough is properly punctured, top with about 1/3 cup sauce, spreading all the way to the edge of dough. Top the entire surface with 2 ounces each of Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese."
50,7568213,9,"Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and bottom of pizza is browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Repeat with remaining ingredients to make 3 more pizzas.Chef John"
51,7566683,1,"Trim ends from zucchini and cut into quarters. Trim out seeds if zucchini are really big. Cut into 1 ½-inch pieces and add to a bowl. Toss thoroughly with 2 tablespoons kosher salt and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes, tossing halfway through."
52,7566683,2,Transfer zucchini to a strainer and rinse off salt very thoroughly. Let drain well before transferring to a bowl.
53,7566683,3,Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil.
54,7566683,4,"Toss zucchini with 2 tablespoons olive oil, toss, and spread out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, making sure zucchini pieces touch each other."
55,7566683,5,"Broil on high heat until zucchini start to brown and are lightly charred, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove pan and turn zucchini pieces over. Return and broil until zucchini are tender but not mushy, and nicely browned, 5 to 6 minutes longer."
56,7566683,6,"Transfer zucchini to a strainer and let drain until cooled to room temperature, about 45 minutes."
57,7566683,7,"Combine drained zucchini, remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, tahini, garlic, lemon juice, basil, ½ teaspoon salt, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne in a blender. Blend until smooth, and taste for seasoning. You can also use an immersion blender."
58,7566683,8,Wrap and chill before serving.Chef John
59,7564661,1,Add cubed peaches to a bowl and toss well with 2 tablespoons sugar. Coverand let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Peaches will release their juice and a syrup will form at the bottom of the bowl.
60,7564661,2,Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
61,7564661,3,"Stir vanilla extract, nutmeg, cinnamon, and panko breadcrumbs into peaches. Add self-rising flour and stir until batter is no longer dry or sticky but fully moistened, about 1 minute. Rest batter for 3 to 5 minutes before frying."
62,7564661,4,"Transfer 6 heaping spoonfuls of batter into the hot oil, and fry for 90 seconds. Carefully tip fritters over to the other side and fry 90 seconds more. Flip again, and cook 1 minute more."
63,7564661,5,Remove to cool on a rack until just barely warm.
64,7564661,6,"To make Bourbon syrup, combine 1/4 cup sugar, water, and Bourbon in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil for 1 minute, and remove from heat. Cool to room temperature. (You can make syrup ahead and refrigerate until needed. This is a very light syrup, so if you want something a little thicker you can boil for an extra minute.)"
65,7564661,7,"Serve fritters with vanilla ice cream and Bourbon syrup.Chef JohnYou can use frozen or canned peaches if fresh peaches aren't available. If using frozen peaches, thaw and drain very well and chop before sugaring. If using canned peaches, skip the sugar and just add a few tablespoons of the syrup from the can to chopped peaches.If you don't have self-rising flour, it is easy to make at home. Sift 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together, then measure out the amount you need for the recipe."
66,7562950,1,"Add beef to a dry cold pot, and turn heat to high."
67,7562950,2,"When beef begins to sizzle, break up into small pieces with a potato masher or spatula. Meat can be broken up into very fine crumbles, or into larger chunks, depending on the desired texture. Continue to cook and break up beef until no longer pink, about 7 minutes."
68,7562950,3,"Add chili powder, chipotle, black pepper, salt, and cinnamon to the pot. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute, then pour in beer."

79,7560707,1,"Add water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and butter to a saucepan. Place over medium heat until butter is halfway melted; turn off heat, and whisk until butter disappears. Let marinade cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes."
80,7560707,2,Cut chicken into halves or quarters and place in a resealable plastic bag. Whisk cooled marinade thoroughly and pour into the bag. Squeeze out air and seal tightly.
81,7560707,3,"Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours and up to overnight, turning the bag occasionally. (At this point, chicken is ready to be roasted or grilled. What follows are instructions for partially baking chicken, then finishing on the grill.)"
82,7560707,4,"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place chicken pieces, skin side up, in a baking dish; pour in all of the marinade."
83,7560707,5,"Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. (At this point, the partially baked chicken can be transferred to a plate and refrigerated until ready to finish cooking on a grill, or you can proceed immediately with grilling.)"
84,7560707,6,"Prepare an outdoor grill with charcoal. Coals should be hot and white, without active flame. Alternately, preheat a gas grill for medium heat."
85,7560707,7,"Pour marinade into a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Set aside to use as a basting sauce and finishing sauce."
86,7560707,8,"Place the chicken on the grill, skin side down. Cook over hot coals with the cover on, adjusting the vents to keep the heat down, until skin has a little color, about 4 minutes. Turn and continue to cook, turning occasionally, basting with sauce each time, 10 to 20 minutes more. The majority of the cooking takes place with the chicken skin side up."
87,7560707,9,"For perfectly cooked breasts, pull breasts off the grill when the internal temperature, measured with an instant-read thermometer, reaches at least 150 degrees F (66 degrees C). For perfectly cooked leg sections, pull off the grill at 175 degrees F (80 degrees C). Tent chicken with foil; rest for 5 to 10 minutes. The internal temperature will continue to rise.Chef JohnFor chicken halves, it will be difficult if not impossible to attain the perfect cooking temperature for breast and leg portions at the same time. You will likely have to pull the chicken off the grill when the breast meat is slightly overcooked, and the leg meat is slightly undercooked. For all the meat to be perfectly cooked, you will need to separate the pieces.You can use the same basic vinegar and butter marinade, but change the spices to create different flavor profiles."
88,7554460,1,"Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray 2 12-cup mini muffin tins with nonstick cooking spray, and use your finger to make sure the inside of each cup is well greased. Place muffin tins on a sheet pan."

107,7547750,3,"Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120  degrees C). Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil long enough to extend past the rack of ribs by at least 6 inches on both ends. Use large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs, meat side up, on the foil."
108,7547750,4,"Brush wet rub over top and sides, and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface. Turn ribs over and, with the bone side up, brush with wet rub, then sprinkle with all the remaining dry rub. Reserve any wet rub left at this point."
109,7547750,5,"Center the ribs lengthwise on the foil, and bring up the ends of the foil, like a boat, and crimp so any juices will stay inside. Crimp the two long edges together over the top of the ribs. The foil doesn’t have to be airtight, but the whole rack should be covered."
110,7547750,6,"Bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours. Remove, open the foil, and pour off juices that have accumulated in the foil into a saucepan."
111,7547750,7,"Turn the rack meat side up, and brush with wet rub. Enclose again in the foil, and continue to roast at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 1 hour."

113,7547750,9,"Bring to a simmer on medium high, cook until liquid is reduced by half. Reduce heat further, and simmer liquids very slowly until they eventually thicken and become sauce-like. Once it is the thickness of barbecue sauce, remove from heat entirely."
114,7547750,10,"After one hour at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), remove ribs from the oven, and open out the foil, pressing foil flat to line the pan."
115,7547750,11,Turn the oven temperature up to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
116,7547750,12,"Brush ribs with sauce. Return ribs to the oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process, brushing ribs with sauce every 15 minutes, until ribs are tender and come easily off the bone, about 1 hour more. (See Note)"
117,7547750,13,"Let ribs rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a sharp knife, and serve with extra sauce.Chef JohnHere’s a trick for telling whether your ribs are done that I learned from an old pitmaster. During one of the bastings near the end of the cooking time, place a pair of tongs under the full length of the center rib, and gently lift the rack off the baking sheet. If the ends of the rack droop, the ribs are nearly done. If the rack remains stiff, the ribs need more cooking time, and if the rack breaks in the center and falls apart, they are overcooked.The video shows an easy way to remove the membrane from the bone side of a rack of ribs, an optional step I rarely take, but I did for this recipe.Feel free to try other flavors of soda with this recipe, like root beer or ginger ale."
118,7511596,1,Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

123,7510692,1,"Combine warm milk, yeast, sugar, salt, and melted butter in thebowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attached. Add egg and flour. Drop down dough hook and start kneading on low speed, stopping and scraping down the sides every so often in the beginning to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Once everything has come together, increase speed 1 notch and continue kneading until dough is very soft, very smooth, and slightly elastic, about 2 minutes."
124,7510692,2,"Transfer dough onto a work surface, knead for 1 minute, and shapeinto a smooth ball. Since the dough has butter in it, it won’t be sticky."
125,7510692,3,"Return dough ball to a lightly buttered bowl. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm spot until it has doubled in size, about 90 minutes."
126,7510692,4,"Once dough is risen, transfer to a work surface and punch down to de-gas. Shape back into a ball, and weigh on a digital scale. Divide amountby 8 and weigh out 8 equal dough portions."
127,7510692,5,"Roll each portion into a smooth ball, using just enough flour to keep it from sticking. Press and flatten the dough into a disc about 3 1/2-inches wide and a 1/2-inch thick. Shape with your hands to make a smallindention in the middle."
